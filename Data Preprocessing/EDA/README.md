**Data Preprocessing & EDA**

📊 EDA: Explore dataset distribution, visualize samples, and check class balance.

🧹 Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and crop faces for consistency.

🔀 Data Split: Create train/test sets while handling imbalance.

✅ Output: Clean, structured dataset ready for model training.



🛠️ Usage


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Data_preprocessing,EDA.ipynb


Run cells to:

Explore dataset statistics

Visualize class balance (male/female)

Apply preprocessing (resize, normalize, split data)

✅ Outcome

Cleaned and structured dataset ready for training.

Visual insights into dataset quality and structure.
